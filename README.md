# distressed-stock-screener

The purpose of this project is to pull individual company information from Yahoo Finance
using specific threshold values for leverage ratios as the main filter constraint
to return an organized database of companies that meet our requirements.

Using Altman Z score and potentially other financial metrics, we can then identify which
companies in the public equities market are close to distressed/bankrupt.

Our final objective is to determine which are worthwhile investments for our personal portfolios.
